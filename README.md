# Rosalind_Stronghold
This Repo is a portfolio of Python 3.9 scripts intended to provide solutions to challenge questions from the Rosalind Stronghold.

The Rosalind Stronghold is a series of problems that are intended to be solved using the Rosalind Python API.
Problem sets are available through the [Rosalind Bioinformatics Stronghold website](https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/).

`.txt` files are provided for each problem set in the `./txt_files` directory. 
Python solutions are preset to source the `./txt_files` directory and print the solutions to the console.
